## Inferring intent

- Interaction design is an artform to make experiences that fluidly respond to human intent
- The goal is to make the layer between software and user intent as thin as possible


## Interaction metaphors
- Great interactions are modeled after properties from the real world, like interruptability

## Ergonmic interactions
- An interface has excellent ergonomics when it is obvious how to use it **before** you use it
- Affordance: indication of how to use an object
- Ergonomics: ease of using an object
- Both are important for good interaction design
- Affordance is easier in real life, because it also has texture, depth, weight, etc. Unlike a screen with only pixels
- Tacttile cues help with mental models and memorising interactions
- Why do we have interfaces with usability issues?
- Trade offs between high usability and visual appeal
- A good rule of thumb is to offer two ways of performing an actionâ€”a visual button and a gesture. Beginners will be able to understand what actions are available in the interface, and over time understand that gestures are a shortcut to those actions
- Fitts' Law: A clever way to increase usability is to make interactive elements be as close to the pointer as possible, whether it be a finger or a cursor
- You might consider placing interactive elements on a mobile device near the bottom where one can reach them the best with a thumb
